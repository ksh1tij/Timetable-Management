# Timetable-Management
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Project: Timetable Management

Create a project where when you send any facultyâ€™s details you would the timetable of that faculty and you would therefore get to know weather he or she is free or not.

This a project I did as my 2nd year Mini-project. As the name says its Timetable Management it finds and displays the timetable you are searching for by accessing a database.

FEATURE

In this project we tried to solve the problem many faculties and student might have faced when they want to contact any faculty or any faculty wants to contact any student, here one will have to enter the faculty details which include his or her name course id and section in which the faculty teaches, or as an alternate method one can enter faculty ID after entering one part of these details the user will get the output where he or she will see the timetable of the faculty and would get to know whether he is free at that time or not.
